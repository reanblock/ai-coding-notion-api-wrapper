# Engineering Conventions

## Conventions
> When writing code, follow these conventions.

- Write simple, verbose code over terse, compact, dense code.
- If a function does not have a corresponding test, mention it.
- When building tests, don't mock anything.

## Project structure

- `modules/`  - Logic
- `tests/`  - Tests
- `index.js`  - Entry point
